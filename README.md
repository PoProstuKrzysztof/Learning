# Learning ü§ì
Learning algorithms and solving problems on leetcode. 

### What I have learned: Project patterns üìù
+ Bridge
+ Composite
+ Decorator
+ Fascade
+ and still going..!

### LeetCode ¬©
For learning algorithms I'm using LeetCode platform to improve my solving problems abilities.

Currently, I'm solving all of the problems starting from the top, with sorting switched to sort from easiest. I decided on this approach 
because I think that by mastering how to solve smaller problems, I may gradually expand my knowledge foundation and progress toward dealing with more complex problems.

### Algorithms
1. Recurisve 
2. Dynamic programming
3. Sorting
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge sort
  - Quick Sort
4. Searching
  - Binary search
  - Linear
